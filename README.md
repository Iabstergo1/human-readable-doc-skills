# Human Readable Doc Skills

This repository provides a Codex skill for document generation and revision. It
turns broad requests such as "write a technical design", "polish this report",
"export to Word/PDF", or "make this README clearer" into a controlled workflow:
route the document type, load focused references, produce Markdown as the source
of truth, and verify the result before delivery.

## What This Solves

- Keeps `SKILL.md` small while giving Codex deeper rules through references.
- Separates writing workflow, human-readable style, document structure, and
  rendering/layout rules.
- Provides standard-library scripts for deterministic checks.
- Treats Markdown as the canonical source for Word and PDF outputs.
- Preserves attribution for methodology references without vendoring upstream
  projects.

## What This Does Not Solve

- It does not replace domain verification for legal, medical, financial, or
  academic claims.
- It does not fabricate citations, benchmark data, authors, DOIs, or sources.
- It does not directly edit Word tracked changes or repair binary PDFs.
- It does not copy upstream skill text, prompts, templates, or repositories.
- It does not introduce heavy dependencies; scripts use Python standard library.

## Four-Layer Framework

1. Writing workflow:
   intake, frame, plan, draft, critique, revise, normalize, finalize.
   Main file: `references/01-writing-loop.md`.

2. Human-readable style and anti-AI:
   keep prose concrete, source-bounded, and non-template.
   Main files: `references/02-human-readable-style.md`,
   `references/03-anti-ai-slop-zh.md`,
   `references/04-anti-ai-slop-en.md`.

3. Document structure:
   route by document type instead of applying one generic outline.
   Main files: `references/05-academic-writing.md`,
   `references/12-document-type-profiles.md`.

4. Rendering and layout:
   keep Markdown source renderable to Word/PDF when requested.
   Main files: `references/06-document-layout.md`,
   `references/07-markdown-authoring.md`,
   `references/08-word-export.md`,
   `references/09-pdf-export.md`.

## Install To Repo Scope

Copy `.agents` into the repository where Codex should discover the skill.

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\target-repo
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force D:\human-readable-doc-skills\.agents .\.agents
Get-ChildItem .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow
```

## Install To User Scope

Use this when your Codex setup loads user-level skills.

```powershell
$source = "D:\human-readable-doc-skills\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow"
$target = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\human-readable-document-workflow"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $source $target
```

## Explicit Invocation

```text
$human-readable-document-workflow 帮我写一份 PDF 预处理架构技术设计文档，输出 Markdown，后续转 Word 和 PDF。
```

## Implicit Triggering

The skill should trigger when the user asks to create, draft, revise, polish,
structure, export, typeset, or generate a reusable document. Typical signals
include document, report, article, paper, proposal, README, Word, PDF, academic
writing, technical documentation, business document, meeting notes, and email.

Short casual answers and code-only tasks should not trigger it unless the user
explicitly asks for a reusable document artifact.

## Maintain References

- Keep `SKILL.md` as the orchestration layer.
- Put long-form rules in `references/`.
- Keep each reference focused on one topic.
- Add a new reference only when a stable topic would otherwise bloat another
  file.
- Keep upstream attribution in both `README.md` and
  `references/11-upstream-attribution.md`.

## Maintain Scripts

Scripts live in:

```text
.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts
```

Rules:

- Use Python standard library first.
- Provide `argparse` CLIs and working `--help`.
- Prefer JSON output for automation.
- Keep conservative fixes separate from lint findings.
- Protect Markdown frontmatter, code fences, tables, URLs, quotes, citations,
  and bibliography entries during style cleanup.

## Replace The Word Template

`assets/reference.docx` is the Word reference document path used by the Pandoc
wrapper. Replace it with your own template when production styling matters.

```powershell
Copy-Item -Force C:\path\to\your-template.docx `
  .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\assets\reference.docx
```

Render Word:

```powershell
python .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts\render_with_pandoc.py `
  .\draft.md --to docx --output .\draft.docx `
  --reference-doc .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\assets\reference.docx
```

## Configure PDF Routes

The PDF layer supports three routes:

| Route | Command family | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pandoc | `render_with_pandoc.py --to pdf` | General Markdown to PDF. |
| Quarto | `quarto render` | Computational reports or Quarto projects. |
| Typst | `typst compile` | Typst-native layouts. |

If the renderer is unavailable, deliver clean Markdown and the command needed to
render locally. Do not claim a PDF exists unless a command created it.

## Validation

Run the skill package validator:

```powershell
python .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts\validate_skill.py --pretty
```

Run routing:

```powershell
python .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts\detect_doc_intent.py `
  --file .\tests\fixtures\doc-intent-technical-zh.txt --pretty
```

Run style lint:

```powershell
python .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts\lint_ai_style.py `
  .\tests\fixtures\ai-slop-zh.md --pretty
```

Run Markdown checks:

```powershell
python .\.agents\skills\human-readable-document-workflow\scripts\normalize_markdown.py `
  .\tests\fixtures\bad-markdown.md --check --report .\tmp\markdown-report.json
```

## License Notes

This repository does not vendor upstream repositories. If future work copies
code, templates, long examples, or protected text from an upstream project,
re-check that project's license file, preserve required notices, and document
the import in `references/11-upstream-attribution.md`.

## Roadmap

- Add more document profiles only when repeated tasks justify them.
- Add renderer-specific templates after real user documents expose layout needs.
- Add optional forward tests using realistic document prompts.
- Add stricter validation for citations and bibliography files when a citation
  workflow is introduced.
